This project is by no means intended to function as financial advice. It is just a fun way to track down potentially fraudulent price increases (e.g., by means of pump-and-dump) by combining an emotional analysis of the surge in articles (as an indicator commotion) with various financial indicators pointing to the purchase volume and the volatility of the crypto.

Again, all stock markets are precarious, to a degree that I am not qualified to assess. Let alone the crypto market, which semi-literate half-broke finance bros mostly run.

Watching the candlesticks move up and down and change colors is fun. It's even more fun to try to predict which direction they will take.

Losing several hundred euros on a cryptocurrency called "Joy," "Happiness," "Prosperity," or "Optimism" is not fun at all.

I mean, to experience it. To watch something like that happen to someone else is super fun.

Anyway, I do this for the practice and the 'told-you-so's. Not for you to lose your money.

Consider yourself warned. Now, go, kids, play around!





(Wow, wow, wow, just before you go! To protect yourselves, the implementation I am running uses local authentication. This means that to input and access data, you need to have SSMS installed and a database promptly named "models"- and not "model" that already exists. I know because I got the gift. Remember to replace my device name with yours and ensure SSMS is set to local authentication! Otherwise, ensure that you're adjusting the pyODBC commands properly to ensure they're done correctly. If you're not savvy with databases, become savvy with databases.)
